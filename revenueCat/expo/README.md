   - npx: npx expo install react-native-purchases react-native-purchases-ui
   - Documentation: https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/getting-started/installation/expo#install-revenuecats-sdks

2. Configure it with my API key: test_eZwgKpwPadYrtvseGiBbwEoIbks

3. Set up basic subscription functionality in Expo

4. Set up entitlement checking for: Mental Math Master Pro

5. Handle customer info and purchases

6. Configure products for my app:

- Lifetime (lifetime)

Please provide step-by-step instructions for Expo implementation with npx. Include:

- Product configuration and offering setup
- Make sure to implement it all using the best modern methods supported by the RevenueCat SDK.
